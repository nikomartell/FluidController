# Fluid Controller

This software was created for use in a Senior Capstone Project in collaboration with Roche.
The purpose of this software is to:
    - Simplify the process of controlling a Fluid Pump
    - Integrate a fluid pump, weight scale, and various sensors into a complete system
    - Automate certain processes of the pump in collaboration with the system

The purpose of the system this controls is to dispense various fluids onto slides for medical chemical analysis

To run the software, run the main.py file.
For the software to operate the system it was made for, the computer must be connected to the system's controller (We used a RaspberryPi) with a weight scale, fluid pump, and fluid sensors connected to it.

This project is currently in development and is purely experimental!
It is a proof of concept for implementation, not to be used as a full product.
Operate carefully!
