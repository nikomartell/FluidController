This software was created for use in a Senior Capstone Project in collaboration with Roche.
The purpose of this software is to:
    - Simplify the process of controlling a Fluid Pump
    - Integrate a fluid pump, weight scale, and various sensors into a complete system
    - Automate certain processes of the pump in collaboration with the system

The purpose of the system this controls is to dispense various fluids onto slides for medical chemical analysis

The software is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi 4B. Some features are proprietary to the system developed with Ventana Roche, such as Priming. Generally, the system requires many explicit parts to function.

The required drivers for the weight scale are included with a script for their installation in the "drivers" folder.
Simply give execution privileges to the installer.sh file, then run it.

It is a proof of concept for implementation, not to be used as a full product.
Operate carefully!
